# Melbourne_Property_Market_Analysis

# Project Description:
A Lottery winner, in her 40s, has won $1M and would like to invest it in her dream family home. She has 2 teenage children, a daughter and a son, who enjoy their own privacy and would love to have a place big enough to invite friends over. Both herself and her husband work in the Melbourne city and they only own 1 car. Considering that this $1M will be her only substantial saving enough to make her dream home come true, she has decided to approach our property investment consultancy firm in order to make the most informed decision for herself and her family. The client has also expressed her preference that if she would be able to find the perfect home below $1M, it would help her to upgrade her car and to buy a second one.
